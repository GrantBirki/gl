We fell in love with this area on a family trip with the Birkinbine family and have since brought the Caragol family too, so we know there are things to do for everyone here! These are some of our favorites 😊

## If you’re feeling active 🏃‍♂️

There's an abundance of outdoor things to do - please keep in mind it can be 20 degrees cooler on the coast so bring layers!

### Hikes / Walks ⛰️

**Monterey Bay Coastal Trail** - this beautiful trail is gravel and flat, following the coast around the peninsula. This is also a great spot to walk and spot sea otters and whales. If the tide is low - go tide pooling!

**Point Lobos State Reserve** - China Cove trail is the best trail in the park and the water is Caribbean blue if it’s a sunny day

**Garapatta State Park** - Calla Lily Valley and Soberanes Canyon Trail are both on Leah’s list of places to go!

**Scenic Bluff Path in Carmel** - walk Scenic Drive along the coast on a beautiful path with spectacular homes (you can also drive this road, which we highly recommend)

### Golf ⛳

Non-guests can play at Pebble Beach golf links by reserving a tee time 24 hours in advance (if you are lucky). Beyond the world-acclaimed Pebble Beach golf links, there are a few public local greens to play at for the day. G & L are not golfers, but research tells us Pacific Grove Golf Links is one option that does not require an overnight stay to play and is on the water.

### Beaches 🏖️

Many beaches on the California coast will take your breath away but the best to spend some time at are Lovers Point Beach, Carmel Beach, and Carmel River State Beach (this is at the end of Scenic Drive). Just be aware that none of these are swimming beaches because of a dangerous riptide.

### Kayaking / Paddle Boarding 🚣‍♂️

Rent a kayak or paddle board in downtown Monterey to explore the kelp forests and see the wildlife!

## If you’re feeling mellow 🧘‍♀️

### 17-mile Drive

You must not miss _17 mile drive_ through Pebble Beach Golf Links. It costs $12 per vehicle and is spectacular. You should stop at the Lodge for lunch and watch the golfers right at hole 18!

### Scenic Drive, Carmel By The Sea 🚗

This is a drive, or walk if you’d like, along the ocean highlighting the special homes of the area, including some iconic fairytale homes, the butterfly house and the Frank Lloyd Wright house.

### Monterey Wine Trail

This trail can be traced back to the 1790s by the first Spanish missionaries and conquistadors who planted the vineyards. There are a dozen local wineries you can visit.

### For the Sea Animal Lovers 🐠

Monterey Bay Aquarium is really worth a visit. The jellyfish were Grant's favorite. You do need to book a ticket online in advance!

Tide-pooling: this is one of Leah’s favorite coastal activities but make sure you have good shoes and are steady on your feet. The best spots are right on the edge of the peninsula in Pacific Grove.

## If you're feeling ready to shop 🛍️

### The Shops 🛒

Carmel by the sea has the cutest shops, dozens of art galleries and even the De Tierra winery tasting room so don’t miss a wander around there. There are many delicious eateries and cafes, many of which we have yet to try. We’re sure you won’t be disappointed. Monterey also has a shopping street called Cannery Row with an interestingly fun history. Pacific Grove has several antique shops and they’re great to wander about, too.

### The Cafes ☕

Carmel has many cafes and bakeries that are worth a visit. You can just stroll around and find one that suits your fancy. There are even a few unique tea shops and specialty chocolate shops as well.
