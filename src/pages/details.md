## About our Wedding

Grant and Leah's wedding will be a small and intimate gathering of friends and family. It will be a full weekend of celebration on the coast by Monterey, California.

Due to our venue being a residential rental property, the amount of guests we can invite is very limited.

This wedding is considered a **micro-wedding** and there will be no more than 32 guests due to venue restrictions.

Our wedding will also be fairly untraditional and unique to us.

## When and Where

- When: Our wedding celebration will be from September 29th, 2024 to October 2nd, 2024 (Sunday to Wednesday)
- Where: [505 Corral De Tierra Rd](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e9ZA5bm9XZ361UqLA) - Salinas, CA

The actual wedding will be taking place on Monday - September 30th, 2024.

The Monterey area in California is absolutely beautiful and we highly encourage you to make a vacation out of it if you can. Feel free to explore the area and enjoy the beautiful coast.

## Accommodations

The property limits the size of the wedding to the number of guests that can stay on the property. We have rented the property for the entire weekend and have booked out all the rooms for guests to stay in. This means that a total of 32 guests can stay on the property.

The property has a few separate buildings with multiple rooms and beds where guests will be staying.

To view more information about accommodations, please visit the [accommodations](/accommodations) page.

The most important takeaway here is that **everyone has accommodations** and you don't need to worry about finding a place to stay. If you are coming to the wedding, you will have a place to stay on the property.

## Venue

The wedding venue is at the _De Tierra Events_ property. This is a rental property that we have booked for the entire celebration. It is where we will be having the ceremony, reception, and all the other wedding festivities!

The venue is beautiful and has a lot of space for guests to relax and enjoy the weekend. To view more information about the venue, please visit the [venue](/venue) page.

## Getting There

There are a few ways to get to the wedding [location](/location). We recommend flying into the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and renting a car to drive to the venue. There will be multiple groups of people driving to the venue, so we can help coordinate rides if needed.

SFO isn't the only airport you can fly into (but it will likely be the most common option). You can also fly into the San Jose International Airport ([SJC](https://www.flysanjose.com/)), the Oakland International Airport ([OAK](https://www.oaklandairport.com/)) or even the Monterey Regional Airport ([MRY](https://www.montereyairport.com/)).

There are a lot of options for getting into the Bay Area via air travel. Take a look at [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) to find the best option for you which will be a balance of cost, convenience, and travel time.

However, if you prefer not to fly there are other options as well. You can drive to the venue which is what a few family members are doing to turn it into a road trip / vacation. You can also take the California Zephyr train which is operated by [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train) and goes from Chicago to San Francisco (with stops in Colorado of course).

## Dress Code

The dress code for the wedding is semi-formal / cocktail attire.
