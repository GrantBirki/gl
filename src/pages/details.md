## About our Wedding

Grant and Leah's wedding will be a small and intimate gathering of friends and family. It will be a full weekend of celebration in the wine country of Northern California.

Due to our venue being a VRBO property, the amount of guests we can invite is very limited.

This wedding is considered a **micro-wedding** and there will be no more than 30 guests due to venue restrictions.

## When and Where

- When: Our wedding will be the whole weekend of September 28th, 2024 (Friday to Monday - 27th -> 30th)
- Where: [Old Hopland, CA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Pyyhy51YdWWvGfnA8)

## Accommodations

We have booked the entire Pinschower Inn, which is a historic bed and breakfast in Cloverdale, California. The venue itself sleeps a few guests but the majority of guests will be staying at the Pinschower Inn.

To view more information about accommodations, please visit the [hotel](/hotel) page.

## Venue

The wedding venue is at the _Dooley Creek Ranch_. This is a VRBO property that we have booked for the entire weekend. It is where we will be having the ceremony, reception, and all the other wedding festivities!

The venue is beautiful and has a lot of space for guests to relax and enjoy the weekend. To view more information about the venue, please visit the dedicated [venue](/venue) page.

## Getting There

There are a few ways to get to the wedding [location](/location). We recommend flying into the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and renting a car to drive to the venue. There will be multiple groups of people driving to the venue, so we can help coordinate rides if needed.

You can also fly into the [Charles M. Schulz - Sonoma County Airport](https://sonomacountyairport.org/) which is a smaller airport that is closer to the venue which is located just outside of Santa Rosa, CA.

However, if you prefer not to fly there are other options as well. You can drive to the venue which is what a few family members are doing to turn it into a road trip / vacation. You can also take the California Zephyr train which is operated by [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train) and goes from Chicago to San Francisco (with stops in Colorado of course).

## Dress Code

The dress code for the wedding is semi-formal / cocktail attire.
