This section goes into detail on FAQs for people helping with the wedding, planning, etc...

## What time is check-in on the first day?

You can check-in anytime on Sunday, September 29th. You may get there as early as you like.

## Bulk Grocery Shopping

There is a Costco, and a Total Wine in Salinas, CA. They are both right next to eachother and about 30 minutes away from the venue (one-way).

## Alcohol Prefernce List

This list is in no particular order. We are not picky about brands, but we do have some preferences. If you can't find something on this list, don't worry about it. Guests will be happy as long as there is alcohol and a bountiful selection.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Many states in the US allow you to returned unopened alcohol to the store you purchased it from. California is **not** one of those states. It is illegal to return alcohol in California.

### Beer

- Summer Shandy
- Blue Moon
- Corona

### Wine

Use your best judgement. I (Grant) don't really drink wine and have not the slightly idea what is good or bad üòÇ.

### Hard Selzter

- ‚≠ê [White Claw](https://www.whiteclaw.com/) (this is the most popular brand by far, this should be the first choice)
- [Truly](https://www.trulyhardseltzer.com/)

### Hard Liquor

It is important to note that the _signature drinks_ for the wedding are **Moscow Mules** and **Mojitos**.

- Vodka (no preference on brand) - This will be used for Moscow Mules
- White Rum (no preference on brand) - This will be used for Mojitos
- Tequila - For shots, makeshift margaritas, and a Moscow Mule alternative... the **Mexican Mule**
- Gin - Good for gin and tonics

### Mixers

Mixers are really up to your own preference if you want to be mixing or making your own drinks. The key mixers that we need are for the signature drinks which are **Moscow Mules** and **Mojitos**. Here are the ingredients for those drinks:

- Lime (for wedges)
- Mint (for garnish)

#### Mojito

## Audio Equipment

The audio equipment is rented for Sunday and Monday. We will need to return it on Tuesday.

I (Grant) will be picking up the equipment on Sunday (September 29th) between 12:00pm and 1:00pm.

The address for pickup is [1737 hickory st. Unit D Sand City, Ca 93955](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LxVCMWCZzVtRxqph7). It is fairly close to the Monterey airport.
