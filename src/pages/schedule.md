> Breakfast at 9:30ish

We will have a pancake and waffle breakfast at the Hacienda House for guests at 9:30ish am & then we HIGHLY recommend you check out the “things to do” page and explore the beautiful coastline of Monterey and Carmel by the Sea. If you’d rather stay on the property, you’re more than welcome to join some in a relaxing day of games, pool time, and a potential winery tour.

For dinner, there will be an informal gathering in the town of Monterey for a fun night out. We will be meeting at an English pub called the [Crown and Anchor](https://g.co/kgs/jYD9Y6W) at 5:30pm for happy hour and pints. The Monterey farmers market is right outside the pub and will be running between 4-7pm if you would like to check that out as well.

After dinner and drinks at the pub, we will be walking over to a game arcade and getting some incredible ice cream from the shop next door. The arcade closes at 10pm and if we are feeling really wild, we might end up at a disco club around the corner that closes at 1am. 💃🕺🪩
