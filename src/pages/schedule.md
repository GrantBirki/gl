> Breakfast at 9:30ish

We will have a pancake and waffle breakfast at the Hacienda House for guests at 9:30ish am & then we HIGHLY recommend you check out the “things to do” page and explore the beautiful coastline of Monterey and Carmel by the Sea. If you’d rather stay on the property, you’re more than welcome to join some in a relaxing day of games, pool time, and a potential winery tour. We won’t be serving a formal dinner so if you are out, then try one of the great spots in the area. Of course, we will have drinks for you to enjoy after your adventurous day!
